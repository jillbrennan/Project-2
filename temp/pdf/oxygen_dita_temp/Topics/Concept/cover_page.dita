However, for some unknown
           reason on 1st December, that transformation stopped working. It gave some errors in the background build.xml file that I didn't know how to fix. 
           I reverted back to the other pdf transformation - based on HTML5 and CSS, which works fine, but the tables no longer display properly I understand from comments in the
           discussion thread on Canvas that this is a restriction of this particular transformation.
